# Climate Change Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on visualizing climate change data to understand the global, national, and city-level temperature trends over time. The datasets used in this analysis come from Kaggle's [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data).

---


## Datasets
The analysis uses three main datasets:
1. **Global Temperatures**: Contains global temperature records over time.
2. **Temperature by Country**: Contains temperature records for various countries.
3. **Temperature by City**: Contains temperature records for different cities worldwide.

These datasets provide insights into overall global trends, variations across countries, and localized changes in cities.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are utilized for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating plots.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Scipy**: For statistical functions, including normal distribution.

## Visualizations
The project includes multiple data visualizations to present temperature trends:
- Global Trends: Visualizing the global temperature variations over time.
- Country Comparisons: Analyzing and visualizing temperature differences across countries.
- City-level Trends: Understanding localized temperature changes in cities.
